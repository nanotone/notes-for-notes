<h2>Der Erlk&ouml;nig</h2>
<h3>Franz Schubert</h3>
</div>
</div>
<p>The first explanatory performance I gave was to a modest audience in a room far too cramped to count as a <em>salon</em>, for Schubert's song "Der Erlk&ouml;nig." The piece, being so rife with plot and metadata, suited the format superbly, and since then I've often wondered about condensing that experience and translating it to the digital.</p>
<p>So, this selection was somewhat of an inevitability. Opening with Erlk&ouml;nig is especially fitting as it was Schubert's Opus One, the first piece he ever managed to publish while still deep in whippersnapper territory. Then and now, there's an all-around sense of hurtling forth, which matches the musical content nicely. When you've sufficiently braced yourself (or been braced by a third party) click play and forge ahead.</p>

<p>[0:00] Schubert wrote this song using the text of the 1782 poem "Der Erlk&ouml;nig" by German literature big-shot Goethe. Goethe, in turn, had recycled the myth of a forest elf king from Danish and German lore.</p>
<p>[0:23] The narrator sets the scene: a father and son on horseback, riding at night through some spook-tastic woods. Allegedly, Goethe penned this after witnessing a man rushing his son to the doctor.</p>
<p>[0:37] Apart from narration duties, Schubert requires the singer to don separate hats for the father, son, and elf king -- a total of four impersonations in his arsenal.</p>
<p>[0:49] The pianist has a single non-speaking role, but it's a taxing one: the horse's relentless gallop.</p>
<p>[0:56] Here's the father asking his son, Why do you hide your face in fear?</p>
<p>[1:04] To which the boy replies, The elf king is near! He's all pale-looking, and has a crown and a cape and everything!</p>
<p>[1:20] Son, it's just a wisp of fog. Relax, it'll be okay.</p>
<p>[1:29] And of course what better time for the elf king to make his appearance, hovering alongside the two with a faint halo, as apparitions are wont to do. (Notice the piano's newly acquired light-footed buoyancy.) He invites the boy to play, offering flowers and golden robes a.k.a. candy and swag.</p>
<p>[1:52] The boy, in that state of delirium characteristic of small children, passes on the elf king's salutations to the father. Kid knows not to take candy from floating glowing strangers. His father brushes him off, thinking it's just the wind.</p>
<p>[2:14] More sweet-talking from the elf king, who now promises dancing and napping and tender caring-for with his daughters. Gotta come clean here, that sounds pretty swank! The elf king comes off as quite a creepy dude though.</p>
<p>[2:31] The son clamors about those sultry daughters. Like clockwork, the father denies it -- this time they're merely "shimmering willows." He's probably gritting his teeth a bit at the kid's hallucinations.</p>
<p>[3:01] The elf king issues his final missive, proclaiming his love for the boy's beauty and seizing him by force. Yep, definitely a child predator.</p>
<p>[3:09] Schubert plays a pretty subtle trick amidst this exchange: the elf king's three speeches are sung at increasingly higher pitches, as are the son's responses -- by now he's escalated to shrieking about the elf king's advances.</p>
<p>[3:22] At which point a fathomable terror finally reaches the father, parental skepticism and all. Holding the boy close, he puts the metal to the horse's proverbial pedal.</p>
<p>[3:39] It's the home stretch to shelter now. By the time they arrive, the horse-pianist is spent.</p>
<p>[3:48] But the child in the father's arms...</p>
<p>[3:53] was dead!</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella (maybe you don't want to admit you sang along to the Disney version) now would be a good time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella">brush up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSm2tQwLuPg">Cinderella: Waltz-Coda &amp; Midnight</a></p>
<p>[0:00] Act II of Sergei Prokofiev's "Cinderella" ballet depicts the evening ball where Cinderella meets her Prince Charming, and is up there as one of the plushiest and glitziest half-hours of music to come out of the guy. So then, why does this waltz sound so grimdark? Three reasons:</p>
<p>[0:16] For starters, being caustic and ironic was kinda Prokofiev's thing. This was the guy who gave pieces titles like "A Diabolical Suggestion" and "Sarcasms." He probably once tried composing without the bile, only to find the next day that it had been rewritten by his Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p>[0:31] Here's one of his little gargoyles, a melody line so angular and jagged that you'd be wise to equip some chainmail before listening. Yet, miraculously, it's still so danceable.</p>
<p>[0:46] Merely being Russian entails a certain pessimism, too. Centuries of bitter winter have distilled a disposition where every "See ya later" also implies "Make sure you have enough vodka to stay warm" and "Try not to get eaten by a wolf on your way home."</p>
<p>[1:02] Listen to that Slavic swagger in the main tune, though.</p>
<p>[1:18] The ballet also needed to appease Soviet arts authorities, who already eyed western fairy tales with stewing suspicion. A palatial evening ball scene, in particular, could not depict royal affairs too rosily. That's like the opposite of communism.</p>
<p>[1:33] Prokofiev's strategy for dealing with that noise was to infuse the imperial court with some grimy mischief, and dilute the plebeian step-sisters a bit. They're more inept than evil, and are often played by dudes in drag.</p>
<p>[1:49] So given the circumstances, this is actually some pretty jolly times.</p>
<p>[1:56] It's the last waltz, and Cinderella has crossed off just about everything on her evening ball to-do list: shown off her dress made from magic, danced around with royalty, and even found true love -- heart-shaped pupils and all.</p>
<p>[2:11] Beware this wonky brass line...</p>
<p>[2:21] A reprise of Cinderella's tizzy of a frolic from earlier in the dance, when she kicked up her glass heels trying to impress the Prince with her mad ballerina skillz. Now she's just showing off with perpetual turns (<em>fouett&eacute;s</em>, they're called!) which is a good way to completely lose track of time.</p>
<p>[2:48] It's time! Fairy-magic-imposed curfew approaches, and with it the danger of being seen without makeup on.</p>
<p>[2:55] The wonky brass turns out to be the twelve dwarves assigned by Cinderella's fairy godmother to put a damper on her night out. Good thing, she might've lost consciousness from all the uncurbed gaiety.</p>
<p>[3:11] Yeah it's not totally clear, why dwarves, and why twelve of them? That's some errant fairy tale mash-upping right there.</p>
<p>[3:24] Prokofiev is just at the peak of his game here. That wood block timekeeping, that brutally awkward silence, that swirling brouhaha of disintegrating ballroom attire, that everything.</p>
<p>[3:42] The clock begins chiming midnight. The score calls for an actual bell, struck twelve times of course.</p>
<p>[4:01] Apparently, Prokofiev's opinion on sad trombones is that the usual dosage of derision needs some amplification. And a distortion pedal, if only he knew how.</p>
<p>[4:20] Here's one of Cinderella's three main themes, symbolizing her longing for the fineries of fairy tales -- princess-hood, love, etc. The arrival of the pumpkin carriage, previously a provider of VIP access, now takes it all away. Vehicular gourds aren't actually very trustworthy, it turns out.</p>
<p>[4:49] And that's a wrap! Enjoy spending Act III, Prince Charming, combing the lands for that one girl based on shoe size...</p>

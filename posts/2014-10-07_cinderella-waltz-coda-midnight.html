<p>If you're unfamiliar with the story of Cinderella (maybe you don't want to admit you sang along to the Disney version) now would be a good time to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinderella">brush up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSm2tQwLuPg">Cinderella: Waltz-Coda &amp; Midnight</a></p>
<p>[0:00] Act II of Sergei Prokofiev's "Cinderella" ballet depicts the evening ball where Cinderella meets her Prince Charming, and is up there as one of the plushiest and glitziest half-hours of music to come out of the guy. So then, why does this tune sound so grimdark? Three reasons:</p>
<p>[0:23] It's Russian! Centuries of bitter winter have distilled a disposition where every "See ya later" also implies "Make sure you have enough vodka to stay warm" and "Try not to get eaten by a wolf on your way home."</p>
<p>[0:39] The ballet needed to appease Soviet arts authorities, who already eyed western fairy tales with stewing suspicion. A palatial evening ball scene, in particular, could not depict royal affairs too rosily. That's like the opposite of communism.</p>
<p>[0:54] Most importantly, being caustic and ironic was kinda Prokofiev's thing. This was the guy who gave pieces titles like "A Diabolical Suggestion" and "Sarcasms." He probably once tried composing without the bile, only to find the next day that it had been rewritten by his Mr. Hyde.</p>
<p>[1:18] So given the circumstances, this is pretty jolly stuff. By this point in the act, Cinderella has already shown off her dress made from magic, danced around with royalty, and even found true love -- heart-shaped pupils and all.</p>
<p>[1:33] A hint of competitiveness here? If Cinderella weren't wearing glass slippers, she and her foul step-sisters would probably be engaged in breakdance battle. The step-relatives are often played by dudes in drag, by the way.</p>
<p>[1:56] Any respectable dance party will reach a certain threshold at which point it is appropriate for all merrymakers to completely lose it. It is the last waltz, after all.</p>
<p>[2:11] This wonky brass line might signal upcoming trouble...</p>
<p>[2:21] A reprise of Cinderella's tizzy of a frolic from earlier in the dance, when she kicked up her heels trying to impress the Prince, and overturned some chairs maybe. Now she's just doing perpetual ballerina turns (at least in most ballet productions) which is an easy way to lose track of time.
<p>[2:48] It's time! Fairy-magic-imposed curfew approaches, and with it the danger of being seen without makeup on.</p>
<p>[3:03] The wonky brass turns out to be the twelve dwarves assigned by Cinderella's fairy godmother to put a damper on her night out. Good thing, she might've lost consciousness from all the unchecked gaiety.</p>
<p>[3:24] Prokofiev is just at the peak of his game here. That wood block timekeeping, that brutally awkward silence, that swirling brouhaha of disintegrating ballroom attire, that everything.</p>
<p>[3:42] The clock begins chiming midnight. The score calls for an actual bell, struck twelve times of course.</p>
<p>[4:01] Prokofiev's opinion on sad trombones is apparently that the usual dosage of derision is in need of some amplification, and perhaps also a distortion pedal.</p>
<p>[4:20] Here's one of Cinderella's three main themes, symbolizing her longing for the fineries of fairy tales -- princess-hood, love, etc. The arrival of the pumpkin carriage, previously a provider of VIP access, now takes it all away. Vehicular gourds aren't actually very trustworthy, it turns out.</p>
<p>[4:49] And that's a wrap! Enjoy spending Act III, Prince Charming, combing the lands for that one girl based on shoe size...</p>
